# Final-Year-Project
My Final Year Project containing code around experiments investigating Bongard Problems with modern neural networks.

This consists of the 6 different experiments I carried out for my Final Year Project.

They explore Simple Neural Nets, Transfer Learning, Pre-trained state-of-the-art image recognition models, embedding and the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
